A presentation at the parallel-in-time [(PinT) 2023](https://www.mat.tuhh.de/veranstaltungen/pint2023/) conference. I discussed using initial conditions of triadic interactions in the rotating shallow water equations to investigate phase-averaging. This allows for a nice analysis of the effect of small and large averaging windows, which affects accuracy and convergence of the parareal method.
