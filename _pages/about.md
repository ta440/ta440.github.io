## My name is Timothy (Charles) Andrews, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Michigan.
I grew up and studied my undergraduate in New Zealand, completed a PhD in the United Kingdom, and am currently researching in the United States. I sometimes get confused about what timezone I am in!

My current research group is the [Atmospheric and Dynamics Modelling Group](https://admg.engin.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan, headed by Professor Christiane Jablonowski.
I am also a code developer for Gusto ([Github](https://github.com/firedrakeproject/gusto), [website](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/gusto/)) a toolbox for solving geophysical fluid equations using compatible finite elements.

P.S. [Kia Ora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_ora) is a Maori greeting we use in New Zealand.

## Research Focuses:
- Numerical modelling of geophysical fluid equations, specifically:
  - Pseudospectral methods
  - Compatible finite element methods
  - Quantification of timestepping error
  - Phase-averaged timestepping and improving its accuracy
  - Parallel-in-time methods
- Development and testing of dynamical cores for Global Circulation Models (GCMs)
- Coupling of models, NOAAâ€™s Unified Forecast System

## Education:
- Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Mathematics (Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics) --- University of Exeter (2020--2024)
- Bachelor of Engineering with First Class Honours, specialising in Engineering Science --- University of Auckland (2016--2019)
