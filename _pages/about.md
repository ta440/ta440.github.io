## My name is Timothy (Charles) Andrews, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Michigan.
I grew up and studied my undergraduate in New Zealand, completed a PhD in the United Kingdom, and am currently researching in the United States. I sometimes get confused about what timezone I am in!

## Education:
- Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Mathematics (Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics) --- University of Exeter (2020--2024)
- Bachelor of Engineering with First Class Honours, specialising in Engineering Science --- University of Auckland (2016--2019)

## Research Focuses:
- Numerical modelling of geophysical fluid equations, specifically:
  - Pseudospectral methods
  - Compatible finite element methods (Gusto code library)
  - Quantification of timestepping error
  - Phase-averaged timestepping and improving its accuracy
  - Parallel-in-time methods
- Development and testing of dynamical cores for Global Circulation Models (GCMs)
- Coupling of models, NOAAâ€™s Unified Forecast System
 
## Collaborations/Projects:
- Gusto: Contributing code to the Gusto repository (https://www.firedrakeproject.org/gusto), a compatible finite element code library for solving geophysical fluid PDEs, utilising the Firedrake python library.
- Tom Bendall (UK Met Office): A conservative transport scheme with compatible finite elements
- Alex Pletzer (NIWA): Mimetic interpolation of output fields from LFRic
