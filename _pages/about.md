## My name is Timothy (Charles) Andrews, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Michigan.
I grew up and studied my undergraduate in New Zealand, completed a PhD in the United Kingdom, and am currently researching in the United States. I sometimes get confused about what timezone I am in!

## Education:
- Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Mathematics (Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics) --- University of Exeter (2020--2024)
- Bachelor of Engineering with First Class Honours, specialising in Engineering Science --- University of Auckland (2016--2019)

## Research Focuses:
- Numerical modelling of geophysical fluid equations
- Development and testing of dynamical cores for Global Circulation Models (GCMs)
- Timestepping methods, including:
  - Quantification of timestepping error
  - Phase-averaged timestepping and improving its accuracy
  - Parallel-in-time methods
