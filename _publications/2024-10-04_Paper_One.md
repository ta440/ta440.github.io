title: "The effect of linear dispersive errors on nonlinear timestepping accuracy in the f-plane rotating shallow water equations"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'This paper investigates new ways to quantify timestepping error in the f-plane rotating shallow water equations. The first part constructs a new triadic error, that measures error within the nonlinear interactions of linear waves. The second part develops two new test cases to highlight slowly developing nonlinear interactions. These are test with three numerical models, including LFRic from the UK Met Office.'
